# Youtube Comments App

The YouTube Comments App is a platform that allows users to interact with videos and engage in discussions by posting comments and replies. The app provides the following functionalities:

1. **Add Videos**: Users can add videos to the app by providing a title and a description. This allows users to upload their content to the platform for others to view and comment on.

2. **Get All Added Videos**: Users can retrieve a list of all the videos that have been added to the platform, including their title and description.

3. **Add Comments on Videos**: Users can post comments on any video, expressing their thoughts, feedback, or questions related to the content.

4. **Add Replies to Comments**: Users can reply to existing comments, creating a nested conversation structure. This allows for more detailed discussions and interactions.

5. **Like Each Comment**: Users have the ability to like individual comments, which allows others to see which comments are most appreciated or helpful.

6. **Get All Comments**: Users can retrieve comments for any video, with the option to sort the comments by either "Newest First" (showing the most recent comments at the top) or "Top Rated First" (showing the most liked or popular comments).

7. **Replies Within Parent Comments**: When retrieving comments, the app returns comments in a nested structure where replies are included within the same object as their parent comment. This ensures that users can easily see the entire conversation thread in a single view.

This structure allows for smooth interactions with videos and their associated comments, fostering an engaging and organized environment for discussions. The app enables users to both contribute to conversations and interact with others' thoughts in a user-friendly way.
